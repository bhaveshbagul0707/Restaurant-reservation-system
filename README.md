# Restaurant-reservation-system
The Restaurant Reservation System is a Next.js web app that lets customers book tables through a simple 3-step flow and prevents double bookings. Admins can view, filter, and cancel reservations. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and localStorage, it features clean UI/UX, clear architecture, and an ER model using Users, Tables, and Reservations.
